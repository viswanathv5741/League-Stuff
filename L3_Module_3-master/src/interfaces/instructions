The abstract class SpecialString has been made for you. Notice how it implements the TextFunkifier interface. 
You must first create that interface with an abstract method called funkifyText. This method will take in a 
String and return a string. Then create the BackwardsString class and MixedCapsString class. Override the 
funkifyText method in both classes to make the tests pass on the TestInterfaces class.
